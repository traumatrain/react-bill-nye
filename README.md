# Bill Nye React App

> Let's create a simple React app!

The goal of this project is to fetch a fact from the Bill Nye API (server must be running locally in addition to this server) and display it. New facts should be fetched and displayed when a button is pressed.

In this project, we will need to make use of several react hooks: `useState` and `useEffect`. State is what will be used to access and set the fetched fact, while the effect will be used to fetch a fact when the page first loads.

## Development setup

1. Clone the repo to your machine with GitHub Desktop
2. In the CLI, `cd` to the cloned folder
3. Run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in watch (live reload) mode

## To-do

- [ ] Add a heading
- [ ] Add a button
- [ ] Create a function to fetch a fact from the Bill Nye API
- [ ] Display the fetched Bill Nye fact

## Code organization and structure

Contributions should be added to the `src` folder.
